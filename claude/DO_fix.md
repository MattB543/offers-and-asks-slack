Of course. I've carefully analyzed the deployment log. This is a classic and very common deployment issue in Node.js applications.

The error message `sh: 1: tsc: not found` is the key. It tells us everything we need to know.

### The Root Cause

1.  **The Change:** In the previous step, we correctly moved `typescript` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies` in your `package.json`. This is the standard practice.
2.  **The Environment:** Your deployment platform (DigitalOcean) sets the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` for the deployment step.
3.  **The Consequence:** When `npm install` runs in an environment where `NODE_ENV` is `production`, it **intentionally skips installing all packages listed in `devDependencies`**. This is an optimization to keep the final production container small.
4.  **The Failure:** Your `package.json` has a `"prestart": "npm run build"` script. When the platform tries to run `npm start`, it first executes `npm run build`. This script tries to run `tsc`, but since the `typescript` package was never installed (because it's a dev dependency), the command `tsc` is not found, and the entire process fails.

The server never starts, which is why the health checks (`Readiness probe failed`) also fail.

### The Fix: Use the Platform's Build Command

The solution is to tell the deployment platform to run the build step during its dedicated **build phase**, where it _does_ install `devDependencies`. You should not run the build as part of the **run phase** (`run_command`).

DigitalOcean App Platform has a specific key for this: `build_command`.

**Action:** You need to make a small change to your `.do/app.yaml` file.

1.  Add a `build_command` to your `web` service.
2.  Remove the `prestart` script from `package.json` as it's no longer needed and is the source of the problem.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: Modify `.do/app.yaml`

Tell DigitalOcean to run the build command separately.

```yaml
# .do/app.yaml

name: helper-matcher-slack
services:
  - name: web
    source_dir: /
    github:
      repo: your-username/offers-and-asks-slack
      branch: main
      deploy_on_push: true
    # --- ADD THIS LINE ---
    build_command: npm run build
    # ---
    run_command: npm start
    environment_slug: node-js
    instance_count: 1
    instance_size_slug: basic-xxs
    http_port: 3000
    envs:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
      - key: SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
        type: SECRET
      - key: SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
        type: SECRET
      - key: OPENAI_API_KEY
        type: SECRET
      - key: DATABASE_URL
        type: SECRET
      - key: ADMIN_USER_ID
        type: SECRET

databases:
  - name: helper-matcher-db
    engine: PG
    version: "15"
    size: db-s-1vcpu-1gb
```

#### Step 2: Modify `package.json`

Remove the problematic `prestart` script. The build is now handled by the platform.

```json
// package.json

{
  "name": "offers-and-asks-slack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "dist/server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    // "prestart": "npm run build",  <-- DELETE THIS LINE
    "start": "node dist/server.js",
    "dev": "ts-node src/server.ts",
    "setup-db": "ts-node src/scripts/setup-database.ts",
    "seed-skills": "ts-node src/scripts/seed-skills.ts",
    "weekly-prompt": "ts-node src/jobs/weekly-prompt.ts",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  }
  // ... rest of the file is correct
}
```

### Why This Fix Works

By separating the commands:

1.  **Build Phase:** DigitalOcean will run `npm install` (installing both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`), followed by your `build_command` (`npm run build`). This successfully compiles your TypeScript into the `dist/` directory.
2.  **Run Phase:** The platform then takes the resulting code (including the `dist/` folder) and runs `npm install --production` (or prunes the dev dependencies). It then executes your `run_command` (`npm start`), which runs `node dist/server.js`. This command now works because the compiled JavaScript already exists.

This is the standard, correct way to deploy a compiled language like TypeScript on modern hosting platforms.

Commit these two changes, and your deployment will succeed.
